# Keep3r V1 Proxy

This contract is designed to hold Keep3rV1 Governance and can trigger any access controlled function on Keep3rV1.

Keep3rV1 is a ERC20 contract that allows minting only to Governance.

This contract was created in order to allow other parts of the protocol that may require to mint KP3R tokens to do so, while not being governance.
